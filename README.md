# JackJewell7-BlenderPaintShader

A program using Blender's Open Source Python API to create an easier way to transfer complex shader node structures from project to project. Instead of building out the node structres from scratch, this program builds the nodes, links them, and connects the output to a shader material. The program is also completely scalable from the base node structure, making it useful for shaders of increasing complexity. 

What I learned:
- Physics simulation with Shader Nodes
- Developing programs with Blender's API
- Software Scalability
- How to work with Open Source Documentation
